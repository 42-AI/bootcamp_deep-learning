This project is a Deep Learning bootcamp **WORKING IN PROGRESS** by  [42 AI](http://www.42ai.fr/).

As notions seen during this bootcamp can be complex, we very strongly advise students to have previously done the following bootcamps:

-   [Python](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python)
-   [Machine Learning](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_machine-learning)


42 Artificial Intelligence is a student organization of the Paris campus of the school 42. Our purpose is to foster discussion, learning, and interest in the field of artificial intelligence, by organizing various activities such as lectures and workshops.
